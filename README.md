# Order Processing System using ASP.NET Core Razor
Order Processing sample application developed in ASP.NET Core Razor(.NET Framework). This application uses Entity Framework as an object-relational mapper to work with relational data(SQL Server) using domain-specific objects. Application uses IdentityServer4 for Authentication and Authorization that underline uses OpenID and OAuth2.

# Create localhost certificate
If you're using a version of Google Chrome prior to version 58, or if you're not using Google Chrome at all, you're good to go. However, if you are using Google Chrome 58 or a more recent version, you'll probably run into another certificate issue. From version 58 onwards, Chrome no longer considers the localhost certificate distributed together with VisualStudio 2017 and IIS Express as safe. In that case, you'll see an error stating the certificate's common name is invalid, as you can see on-screen. Luckily, there's a way to fix this. You can execute PowerShell script on this page. It will generate a new certificate that is considered safe.

Execute the script below in Powershell (run as Administrator) if you're using Google Chrome 58+ and are seeing an error stating the certificate's common name is invalid.

Script coming from https://gist.github.com/camieleggermont/5b2971a96e80a658863106b21c479988


```
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "localhost", "localhost" -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My" -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(5)
$thumb = $cert.GetCertHashString()

For ($i=44300; $i -le 44399; $i++) {
    netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:$i
}

For ($i=44300; $i -le 44399; $i++) {
    netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:$i certhash=$thumb appid=`{214124cd-d05b-4309-9af9-9caa44b2b74a`}
}

$StoreScope = 'LocalMachine'
$StoreName = 'root'

$Store = New-Object  -TypeName System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Store  -ArgumentList $StoreName, $StoreScope
$Store.Open([System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.OpenFlags]::ReadWrite)
$Store.Add($cert)

$Store.Close()
```

# Getting Started
